This is my revised version of the first project in TOP, which is to recreate the google homepage with HTML/CSS.

The first time I did the project, I got it all thrown together in about 8 hours. But when I was done, I don't think I could have replicated the process very well. In the end, I felt like I didn't understand CSS well enough to move forward.

And so I decided to do another version of the project. I watched the Wes Bos CSSGrid videos on youtube and made this project in CSS Grid. 

My biggest struggles were:
    * Positioning and learning align/justify
    * Figuring out how to properly layout and arrange grid elements
    * Attempted to do the magnifying glass in the search box but was unable to do so successfully. This is something I may revisit at a later time.
